      "## TL;DR\n",
      "I help my girlfriend looking for a flat using (I)Python and friends. I showcase some Python libraries like Pandas and Scrappy along with some features of IPython notebook to work with Google Maps API. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Intro\n",
      "Moving to a new city is not an easy task. Among all the things, one of the most time consuming is finding a place to live. It is not easy, there are many variables to take into account and if you don't use an agency looking for one might be boring and repetitive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming you use the web to get some possible apartments, once you find a good candidate, you generally have to check the address, check  the surroundings (e.g. Stores, Cafes) and which public transportation is available. You generally also have to check how long it will take you to get to your working place or the city center,  either by car or public transportation. This is important, as [Stutzer and Frey found](file:///Users/miguel/Downloads/iewwp151.pdf) _\"that a person with a one-hour commute has to earn 515 Euro more (or 40% of an average monthly wage in Germany) to compensate for the dissatisfaction caused by their long commute\"_ [[source]](http://www.elezea.com/2013/11/money-satisfaction/).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you use Google or specialized websites like [ImmobilienScout24](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/) (in Germany), you probably have to go through  process of searching for it, checking wheter  that apartment matches your criteria (i.e. number of rooms, size, rent price, etc). In addition to that, to that you have to check how far or how much time will you need to get to work. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is actually a nice tool written by a Berliner that can help you with the last part called [Mapficient](http://www.mapnificent.net/). Mapficient can show you graphically  areas you can reach with public transport in a given time and it is available for many cities.  However, in order to use the toold you have to add the latitud and longitude coordinates manually for each of the candidate apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the problem that my girlfriend is facing. She is moving to Berlin next month and she wants an apartment that matches her criteria and from where she could reach her working place in the shortest possible amount of time. So I decided to help her (us?) a bit with some assistance of Python/IPython and some services. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I read [Karim's](http://funnybretzel.svbtle.com/datamining-a-flat-in-munich) blog post and attended his [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/munichdata/karim-jedda-datamining-a-flat-in-munich) at the [Munich Datageeks](http://munich-datageeks.de/) Meetup, I got interested in how to harness open data to automate or improve otherwise boring and  time-consuming tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also googled a little bit before coding and stumpled upon a nice [article](https://robinclarke.net/archives/displaying-transit-times-on-a-map-munichmvv) by [Robin Clarke](https://robinclarke.net/), a guy living in Munich, and how he looked for an area in the city where he could reach the center of Munich in a specific time. He even built a super duper visualization that you can see below:"

      "The lighter the area the less time you need from that location to reach the Munich's city center.

This was a nice opportunity to learn a bit about it.  I wrote a small python project that scraps ImmoScout24 listings and stores the results in a JSON file.  Before doing that,  it uses Google Map services to geocode the address and calculate the distance to my girlfriend's workplace using public transportation. To do that,  I use what Scrapy calls an [ItemPipeline](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.24/topics/item-pipeline.html) and Google Maps services [client](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python). I only limited it to Kreuzberg, Schoenegerberg and Charlottenburg as they still close to the city center but are still in the direction of her workplace.\n",
